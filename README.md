Using ML to identify predictors of morbidity and mortality in PPCM

Aim: using Machine learning to identify predictors of morbidity and mortality in PPCM and using predictors to predict survival and morbidity.

Objectives:

Using simple statistical methods find features associated with each outcome variables. PCC

Using ML algorithms find features associated with each outcome variables. Recursive Feature Elimination

Compare the results of 1 & 2 above

Use selected features to Predict outcome variables - ML algorithms (Supervised learning model)
